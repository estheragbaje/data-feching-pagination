# Data Fetching + Pagination

This repository demonstrates how to perform data fetching and implement pagination using the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/) API. The JSONPlaceholder API provides a simulated RESTful API for testing and prototyping.

## Getting Started

To get started with data fetching and pagination, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/estheragbaje/data-fetching-pagination.git
   cd data-fetching-pagination

   ```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server

```
npm start
```

## Next steps

This application serves as a learning resource for implementing data fetching and pagination. You can study the code and adapt it to your own projects that involve consuming APIs and handling pagination.

Feel free to build on this by exploring the source code and experimenting with different pagination techniques, improving the styling or applying this knowledge to real-world applications.
